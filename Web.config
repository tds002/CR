    <add key="OtherSexDes" value="Sex crimes are not limited to rape and sexual assault. Other types of offensive and unacceptable behavior are crimes and should be dealt with accordingly.

* When you walk at night, select well-lit areas where other people are present. Avoid alleys and back streets. Don’t walk next to dense shrubbery or in other places where an attacker could hide.
* Never hitchhike.
* Always have your keys in your hand as you approach your front door or car. You will be less vulnerable because you can get inside quicker.
* Carry a whistle to summon help.
* Before you go anywhere, let your friends and family know when you will return. Work out a system so that friends will notify the College Police Department if you do not return within a specified time.
* Stay with your group at parties. Many attacks have occurred after friends were persuaded to leave because the victim said, “Go on without me. I’ll be fine.”
* Keep windows, screens, and doors locked at all times. Keep drapes closed so that persons outside cannot see into rooms.
* Report any suspicious persons or activity to the College Police Department."/>

Details of the exhibitionist’s appearance will help the police identify the individual, so try to get a good look at the offender.

You should follow the same guidelines if you observe a voyeur. Also, be sure to lock all doors and windows immediately."/>
    <add key="PhoneDes" value="Always use the telephone on your terms, not the terms of the caller. Don’t talk to anyone unless you want to and never volunteer your name to the unknown caller. Hang up at once if a caller makes obscene or harassing remarks or does not respond to your, “hello”.
You should always be wary of callers who say they are conducting a survey. Criminals often use this as a ruse to get confidential information such as credit card numbers or bank account locations. If you suspect that a call is not legitimate, get the caller’s name, company affiliation, and phone number. You can call back after you have verified the authenticity of the call.
Crank phone callers often obtain numbers from classified ads. If you place an ad, use a box number or list your phone number without your address. You should also be careful about recording unusual messages on your phone answering machine. Police report than many crank calls originate after the word spreads about a unique message on an answering machine."/>
    <add key="PhoneGud" value="Some other sug-gestions for dealing with obscene or crank callers:
* Don’t play detective, counselor, or comedian. This is just what the caller wants.

If the shooter leaves the area, proceed immediately to a safer place and do not touch anything that was in the vicinity of the shooter.
No matter what the circumstances, if you decide to flee during an active shooting situation, make sure you have an escape route and plan in mind. Do not carry anything while fleeing; move quickly, keep your hands visible, and follow the instructions of any police officers you may encounter. Do not attempt to remove injured people; instead, leave wounded victims where they are and notify authorities of their location as soon as possible.

The officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, or handguns, and might be using tasers, pepper spray, or tear gas to control the situation. Regardless of how they appear, remain calm, do as the officers tell you, and do not be afraid of them. Put down any bags or packages you may be carrying and keep your hands visible at all times; if you know where the shooter is, tell the officers. The first officers to arrive will not stop to aid injured people; rescue teams composed of other officers and emergency medical personnel will follow the first officers into secured areas to treat and remove injured persons. Keep in mind that even once you have escaped to a safer location, the entire area is still a crime scene; police will usually not let anyone leave until the situation is fully under control and all witnesses have been identified and questioned. Until you are released, remain at whatever assembly point authorities designate."/>

With identity theft and fraud, which are often computer-aided, there are measures that can be taken to reduce or minimize the risk of becoming a victim. These measures can be taken by remembering the word “SCAM.”
S – Be STINGY about giving out personal information to others unless you have a reason to trust them. Limit the information on personal checks; don’t have your Social Security, driver’s license, or telephone numbers printed on them. Should someone telephone or send an electronic message (e-mail with an “unbelievable” credit card offer or notification of an alleged “prize” being won, do not offer any personal data, but rather ask that they mail an application or written notification of some type). If one is later received from a company, the Better Business Bureau can be contacted in an effort to determine whether or not the company is legitimate.
C – CHECK financial information regularly and examine records for an unrecognized/unauthorized transactions. Should such transactions be noted, the bank institutions and credit card companies should be contacted immediately.
A – ASK periodically for a copy of your credit report. The three principal credit reporting companies are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. These three companies, as well as the United States Federal Trade Commission, are accessible online.
M – MAINTAIN careful records of banking and financial records as well as personal computer security.

    <add key="EmNoteSysDes2" value=" has invested in several multi-modal forms of communications that allow administrators to distribute notices in the event of a critical incident or dangerous situation.

Confirming the Existence of a Significant Emergency or Dangerous Situation and Initiating the Emergency Notification System:
The College Police Department and/or other campus first responders may become aware of a critical incident or other emergency situation that potentially affects the health and/or safety of the campus community. Generally, campus first responders become aware of these situations when they are reported to the College Police Department or upon discovery during patrol or other assignments.
Once first responders confirm that there is, in fact, an emergency or dangerous situation that poses an immediate threat to the health or safety to some or all members of the campus community, first responders will notify supervisors in the College Police Department or other authorized College offices to issue an emergency notification.
The College's authorized representatives, including supervisors in the College Police Department, individuals assigned to Environmental Health and Safety, officials in the Office of College Relations, and/or other members of the College's senior administration, will immediately initiate all or some portions of the College's emergency notification system. If, in the professional judgment of first responders, issuing a notification potentially compromises efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency, the College may elect to delay issuing an emergency notification. As soon as the condition that may compromise efforts is no longer present, the College will issue the emergency notification to the campus community or applicable segment of the community.

Determining the Appropriate Segment or Segments of the Campus Community to Receive an Emergency Notification:
Campus and local first responders on the scene of a critical incident or dangerous situation that poses an immediate threat to the health or safety of the campus community will assist those preparing the emergency notification with determining what segment or segments of the campus community should receive the notification. Generally, campus community members in the immediate area of the dangerous situation (i.e. the building, adjacent buildings, or surrounding area) will receive the emergency notification first. The College may issue subsequent notifications to a wider group of community members. In addition to the emergency notification that may be issued via the College mass notification system, the College will also post applicable messages about the dangerous condition on the College homepage to ensure the rest of the campus is aware of the situation and the steps they should take to maintain personal and campus safety. If the emergency affects a significant portion of or the entire campus, College officials will distribute the notification to the entire campus community.

Determining the Contents of the Emergency Notification:
The Office of College Relations will, with the assistance of campus and local first responders, determine the content of the notification. The College has developed a wide range of template messages addressing several different emergency situations. The Director of College Relations will select the template message most appropriate to the on-going situation and modify it to address the specifics of the present incident. Those issuing the notification will use the following guide-lines when determining the contents of the emergency message.

The first message is intended to Alert the community or appropriate segment of the campus community of the dangerous condition and the actions they should take to safeguard their and their neighbors’ safety. Messages distributed in this stage of a rapidly unfolding critical incident will generally be short, precise, and directive. Examples include: “The campus is experiencing a major power outage affecting the following buildings: McCoy, Parsons, and Marietta Halls. All occupants of these buildings should immediately evacuate and meet at the designated building rally point.”

The second message is intended to Inform the community or appropriate segment of the campus community about additional details of the situation. This message is generally distributed once first responders and the Emergency Operations Center has additional information about the dangerous situation. Examples include: “The power outage affecting McCoy, Parsons, and Marietta Halls was caused by a cut power line. PSE" />
    <add key="EmNoteSysDes3" value="G are responding along with Physical Plant personnel to repair the damage. We expect the outage will last until 2:00 p.m. Refer to the College homepage for additional information or dial"  />
    <add key="EmNoteSysDes4" value=".

Finally, the third message is the Reassure notice that is generally distributed once the situation is nearly or completing resolved. The purpose of this message is to reassure the community that the College is working diligently to resolve the dangerous situation. It can also be used to provide additional information about the situation and where resources will be available.

In those cases where there are no predetermined template messages in the system, the individual issuing the alert will send and develop the most succinct message to convey the appropriate message to the community. The goal is to ensure individuals are aware of the situation and that they know the steps to take to safeguard their personal and community safety.

Procedures Used to Notify the Campus Community:
In the event of a situation that poses an immediate threat to members of the campus community, the College has various systems in place for communicating information quickly. Some or all of these methods of communication may be activated in the event for emergency notification to all or a segment of campus community. These methods of communication include the mass notification system known as the " />
    <add key="EmNoteSysDes5" value =" System, the College’s email system, and through mass text messaging. The College will post updates during a critical incident on the homepage. If the situation warrants, the College will establish a telephone call-in center staffed by College specialists who are trained to communicate with the campus community during an emergency situation."/>
